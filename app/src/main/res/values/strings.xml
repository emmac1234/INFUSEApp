Research shows that more than 65% of our students will work in jobs that donâ€™t exist today. By engaging participants in Girls in ICT Day, we hope to help prepare for that future, encouraging more and more girls to consider careers in ICT. Technology keeps the world connected. Ericsson is a master of this connection! Why is ICT important for girls? When women and girls have access to the Internet, they have the opportunity to start new businesses, sell products to new markets, find better-paid jobs and access education as well as health and financial services.</string>
